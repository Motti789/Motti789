### Hi there! I'm Motti! ðŸ‘‹

Dedicated full stack developer with a passion for problem solving and working together with others.

I enjoy analyzing details with a natural desire to learn and grow.

## Projects
**Healthcare Provider** [Demo](https://youtu.be/3Jy239mGayw) | [Repo](https://github.com/Motti789/healthcare_provider)
<br>
Created an App with a Rails backend and React frontend to allow users to add clients with all the relative info, as well as add client session notes. Used the Redux library for managing state.
